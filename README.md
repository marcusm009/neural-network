# neural-network

A personal project where I put my newly learned machine learning skills to the test by building my own reusable neural network in Python. The goal of this project is to create a scalable, customizable Neural Network class that has features such as stochastic/batch gradient descent, back and forward propagation, gradient checking, cost vs. iteration graphing, multiple layers (with or without bias), and loading and saving parameters to files. Eventually I may add the ability to specify different activation and loss functions once I learn more about deep learning.
